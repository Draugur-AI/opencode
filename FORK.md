# FORK.md

## What this fork is

`Draugur-AI/opencode` is a fork of [`anomalyco/opencode`](https://github.com/anomalyco/opencode)
carrying the **OpenCode reliability redesign**: one authoritative model for projects and session
lifecycle, and one durable model for what an agent is trying to achieve, replacing a set of
disconnected browser-side workarounds. The redesign is specified in three posts, all reviewed
against upstream `dev` at commit
[`0bff28de`](https://github.com/anomalyco/opencode/commit/0bff28de09105088ff5bdefab91413d55c28dff1)
on 2026-08-10. That commit is a permanent spec anchor: the posts' file/line citations and the
recorded build/test baseline stay pinned to it and are never re-anchored. The fork's **sync
base** — the point its `dev` has merged upstream through — is a separate, moving thing; it
advances weekly under the sync policy below and is tracked by the sync PRs themselves, not by
this file.

- [Making OpenCode dependable for long-running work](https://drafts.draugur.ai/2026-08-10-making-opencode-dependable-for-long-running-work.html) — the product design
- [Building the OpenCode reliability redesign](https://drafts.draugur.ai/2026-08-10-building-the-opencode-reliability-redesign.html) — the schema/service/protocol map
- [Validating the OpenCode reliability redesign without regressions](https://drafts.draugur.ai/2026-08-10-validating-the-opencode-reliability-redesign.html) — the test and rollout plan

A change that is not traceable to one of these three posts, or to keeping the fork buildable and
in sync with upstream, does not belong here. This file states the policy that keeps the fork
mergeable back into a fast-moving upstream instead of drifting into an unmaintainable rewrite.

## Upstream-sync policy

- **Cadence:** merge upstream `dev` into this fork's `dev` **weekly**. Do not wait until the
  redesign, or any milestone of it, is complete — the build post is explicit that upstream
  drift, not implementation difficulty, is the dominant long-term cost of a fork left to diverge.
- **Budget:** a sync that costs more than **one engineer-day** to resolve is over budget. The
  lead (`Ethan`, or whoever holds that role at sync time) can adjust the budget for a specific
  sync in advance, but the default is one engineer-day and no sync silently gets more than that.
- **Measure it:** record start time, end time, and conflicted-file count for every sync in the
  divergence ledger below or in the syncing PR's description. This is what "exceeds the budget"
  is checked against — not a feeling.
- **On exceeding budget:** pause new feature work and open a ticket (or comment on the existing
  sync ticket) naming which files conflicted and why. Resolving upstream drift takes priority
  over the next redesign slice until the sync lands.
- **How to keep syncs cheap:** every fork-only change follows the PR conventions below. A sync
  that is expensive because of our own formatting or renaming churn is a self-inflicted cost, not
  evidence upstream moved unusually fast.

## Divergence ledger

Every intentional divergence from upstream — anything upstream would not accept as-is, or that we
are deliberately holding back from proposing — gets a row here at the time it merges. This table
is the fork's memory: a later agent should be able to tell what is fork-only, why, and what
retires it without reading every PR.

| Change | Why | Upstream issue/PR | Schema impact | Migration impact | Resolution |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| _(none yet — add a row per divergence as it lands)_ | | | | | upstream / keep / remove |

**Resolution** is one of:

- **upstream** — intended to be proposed back to `anomalyco/opencode`; link the issue/PR once filed.
- **keep** — fork-only by design (e.g. product positioning specific to this deployment); state why
  it can never go upstream.
- **remove** — a temporary compatibility shim (a V1 adapter, a migration column) with a stated
  condition for deleting it (see the build post's "Migrations and compatibility" section and its
  vertical-slice removal steps).

A row is never deleted, only marked resolved — the ledger's value is in showing what has *already*
been reconciled, not just what is currently outstanding.

## PR conventions

- **Vertical slices, package boundaries preserved.** Follow the dependency direction in the build
  post: `packages/schema` → `packages/core` → `packages/protocol`/`packages/server` →
  `packages/client` → `packages/app`. A PR that reaches across that graph without a schema-first
  change underneath it is doing the redesign out of order.
- **No formatting, generated-code, or renaming churn.** These are exactly the diffs that make
  every future sync more expensive without moving the redesign forward. If a file must be
  reformatted, do it in its own commit with nothing else, and expect it to be deferred rather than
  bundled into a feature PR.
- **Generated clients are regenerated, never hand-edited.** After any `packages/protocol` change:
  `bun run --cwd packages/client generate` then `bun run --cwd packages/client check:generated`.
  A hand-edited generated file is treated as a bug, not a shortcut.
- **Fork-only behavior stays behind capability discovery while contracts are experimental** — not
  behind scattered build-time flags. A client (or upstream) that does not know about a fork-only
  capability should degrade cleanly, not fail to build or silently omit behavior.
- **Every PR carries its validation dossier** per the validation post: invariants touched,
  fixtures exercised, crash/differential/browser cases added as applicable, performance budget
  before/after where relevant, and compatibility paths retained plus their removal condition.
- **No automated review exists on fork PRs yet** (tracked in the CI/review bootstrap task). Until
  that changes, say so explicitly in every PR and report — local per-package tests are the gate,
  and an absence of review comments is not evidence of a clean diff.

## Merge-blocking gates

These gates are **merge-blocking conditions**, not aspirations. A PR that trips one does not
merge until it passes, regardless of who wrote it or how much of the milestone it represents.

### The three stop/go gates (design and build posts)

1. **Lifecycle gate** — do not build UI features on session or project state until snapshot,
   event, reconnect, and tab-reconciliation tests pass with duplicate and reordered delivery.
2. **Agent-memory gate** — do not claim compaction reliability until repeated-compaction
   evaluations preserve exact constraints and the runner demonstrably reloads goal, ledger, and
   profile versions.
3. **Monitor gate** — do not expose Monitor over the web until durable ownership, permission
   parity, output redaction, restart recovery, cancellation, and authorization tests all pass.

### The four release gates (validation post)

1. **State gate** — snapshots, duplicate and reordered events, retries, reconnects, and
   two-window tests converge for session and project state.
2. **Data gate** — every supported historical fixture upgrades, restarts, remains readable, and
   passes the backup-restore drill; the purge inventory is complete.
3. **Agent gate** — repeated-compaction evaluations preserve exact active constraints and recover
   omitted details within deterministic context budgets.
4. **Background and client gate** — Monitor containment, authorization, crash recovery,
   real-browser lifecycle, and performance budgets pass on the supported platform matrix.

A milestone's PRs are free to land independently, but none of them may claim a gate is satisfied
on the strength of a green test suite alone — the validation post is explicit that no single green
suite proves the absence of regressions. Cite the specific evidence (fixture, crash matrix row,
differential test, telemetry threshold) the gate asks for.
